# Machine Learning Projects  
This repository contains a collection of machine learning implementations and experiments, developed as part of academic and practical projects. It covers a range of approaches including:

- Genetic Programming for optimization and model generation  
- Ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting, and stacking  
- Naive Bayes classifiers for probabilistic learning and text classification  
- Evaluation with standard metrics and comparisons across models  
- Experiments using example datasets and reproducible pipelines  

The goal is to provide hands-on experience in implementing, testing, and analyzing fundamental machine learning algorithms in different contexts and scenarios.
